 ## Overall Description 
 - - - 

For right now, this is a very bare bones weather dashboard. There are plans to do more with it, however in the meantime its a simple wasy to use tool to lookup the most need-to-know information for any given day of the week based on city.



 ## Installation Instructions
 - - -

No install required as this is a web based application.

 ## Instructions/How To Use
 - - -
 
 Enter a city name in the search bar and it will generate a 7 day forecast for that city.

 ## Contribution Guidelines
 - - -
 If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to do so. Some things to keep in mind:

 1. Please use structured/formatted commit messages that adhere to the following guideline: git commit -m "{the version you are working from, ie, 1.1.x}" -m "{detailed description of the changes}" -m "{this bit is optional but who it is and the date}"
 for now this is just a personal preference to keep the repository nice and tidy, eventually these guidelines will be updated to reflect whatever version nomenclature i decide to use. 

 2. Do Not open a pull request on the main branch, it will be denied. period. Start a new feature branch or open a pull request to develop so your contributions can be reviewed first. 

 3. Comment your code, since I didn't write your code i might not know right away what it does. Please keep your code clean, tidy, and well commented to make integration of features more seamless. 

 4. if you'd like to be a regular contributor reach out and ask to be a collaborator,
